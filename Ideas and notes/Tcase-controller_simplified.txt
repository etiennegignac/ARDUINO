FIRST SKETCH: POSITION SNIFFING

- Make sure truck is running for full voltage and in neutral.
- Move tcase all the way to 2wd
- "Start"
- LOOP: Read pin status
	- If different than last pin status: output pic status.  last pin status = current position
- Force past 2wd position
- Move all the way to 2LOW
- Should have a complete list of positions



SECOND SKETCH: TCASE OPERATIONS

STATUS LEDs ON CASE ITSELF AND MAYBE LATER IN HOLLEY DASH
- Moving at all
- Moving POSITIVE TRACTION (towards 4LO)
- Moving NEGATIVE TRACTION (Towards 4HI)
- Currently 2WD
- Currently 4HI
- Currently 4LO
- Some sort of error?

Maybe use a full blown display?

BOOT

	- Show status: initial setup
	- Setup pins, timers, etc.
	- Start 2 second timer to read TCASE encoder
		- Store current TCASE position
		- If fail, show status failed read tcase
	- Start 2 second timer to read dash switch position
		- Store current dash switch position
		- If fail, show status failed read dash switch
	- Show status going to initial position
	- Compare dash switch and tcase encoder (initial position)
		- If known position, show status of actual position

	- If unknown position
		- Show status moving in whichever direction
		- Wait until we get there, check check check
		- Stop when we are there
		- Show status of actual position
