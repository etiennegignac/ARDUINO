# Arduino
Repo for everything running on an Arduino

This repo should have different folders for every arduino sketch.  You should only have to set your sketchbook path in the IDE to the Arduino folder sync'ed.

Sketches:

- pedalServoDriver: reads drive-by-wire fuel pedal TPS and moves a servo pulling the throttle cable.
- pedalServoDriverCAL: used to figure out the min and max voltages of the pedal TPS and the min and max positions of the servo for pump actuation.
